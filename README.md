# Rec_Sys_for_Recipe_Website

Here you can find my implementation of the the recommendation system for the website with recipes (URL: https://www.allrecipes.com/), whose task is to choose such a recipe for the user that he/she is most likely to enjoy based on his/her previous reviews. 

The RecSys was built using four approaches: user-based kNN, item-based kNN, logistic regression and even simple neural network with few layers. Surprisingly, even simple deep learning model greatly surpasses listed above baselines models.
